with brief explanations or implementation ideas.

1. Direct-style interpreter, direct-style program

2. Direct-style interpreter, CPS-transformed program

3. CPS-transformed interpreter, direct-style program

4. CPS-transformed interpreter, CPS-transformed program

# Lambda Lifting vs. Closure Conversion

# Defunctionalization

1. Explain what defunctionalization is and what it is good for.

2. Lambda-lift the following program:
    
    ```scala
    def fold[A, B](f : (A, B) => A, z : A, l : List[B]) : A = 
      l match {
        case Nil => z
        case x :: xs => fold(f, f(z, x), xs)
      }

    fold((x, y) => (x + y) / 2, 1, List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
    ```

3. Defunctionalize the resulting program from above.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the following use of `fold`.

    ```scala
    fold((f : Int => Int, g : Int => Int) => (z : Int) => f(g(z)),
         (z : Int) => z,
         List(x => x + 1, x => x + 2, x => x - 1, x => x * 2))
    ```
