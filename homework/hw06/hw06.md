## Continuation-Passing Style

What is continuation-passing style?  What is the characteristics of programs in
continuation-passing style?

## Manual CPS-Transformation

For the following exercises, you can use `==`, `*`, `-`, `<` and `+` as
primitive functions directly without transforming them.  For Exercise 1 and 2,
do stack-overflow exceptions still occur when executing the transformed program
on large inputs?

1. CPS-transform the factorial function in Scala by hand:

    ```
    def fact(n : Int) : Int = if (n == 0) 1 else n * fact(n - 1)
    ```

2. CPS-transform the Fibonacci function by hand.

    ```
    def fibo(n : Int) : Int = if (n < 2) 1 else fibo(n - 2) + fibo(n - 1)
    ```

3. CPS-transform the `fold` function by hand.

    ```
    def fold(f : (Int, Int) => Int, z : Int, xs : List[Int]) : Int = xs match {
      case Nil => z
      case x :: ys => f(x, fold(f, z, ys))
    }
    ```

## Automatic CPS-Transformation

In the [2nd lecture](../../lecturenotes/14-cpstransformation2.scala) on
CPS-transformation, we define two new syntactic categories, namely `CPSVal` and
`CPSExp`, for CPS-transformed terms.  In particular, the functioin `cps` takes
an `Exp` as input and returns a `CPSCont` as output.  CPS-transformation can be
done as a desugaring procedure which transforms an `Exp` to an `Exp`.  Start
with the following declarations, reimplement this desugaring-style
CPS-transformation.

```scala
abstract class Exp

case class Var(name : Symbol) extends Exp
case class Fun(pname : Symbol, body : Exp) extends Exp
case class App(fexp : Exp, aexp : Exp) extends Exp
case class Num(num : Int) extends Exp
case class Add(lhs : Exp, rhs : Exp) extends Exp
case class If0(cond : Exp, texp : Exp, fexp : Exp) extends Exp
case class Wth(vname : Symbol, vdef : Exp, body : Exp) extends Exp

abstract class Val

type Env = Map[Symbol, Addr]

case class NumV(num : Int) extends Val
case class CloV(pname : Symbol, body : Exp, env : Env) extends Val  // closure

def cps(exp : Exp) : Exp = ...
```

Recall that the `Wth`-construct can also be defined as follows:

```scala
def Wth(vname : Symbol, vdef : Exp, body : Exp) : Exp =
  App(Fun(vname, body), vdef)
```

Hence we have `Wth('x, Num(1), Add(Var('x), Num(1))) == App(Fun('x,
Add(Var('x), Num(1))), Num(1))`.  Now use your `cps` to transform both sides of
`==`.  Compare the results of the transformation.  Are they still equivalent?
Why?
