# Homework 6

## Continuation-Passing Style

What is continuation-passing style?  What is the characteristics of programs in
continuation-passing style?

## Manual CPS-Transformation

CPS-transform the following three functions in Scala by hand.  You can leave
`==`, `*`, `-` and `+` as is without transforming them.

```scala
// the factorial function
def fact(n : Int) : Int = if (n <= 0) 1 else n * fact(n - 1)

// the Fibonacci function
def fibo(n : Int) : Int =
  if (n <= 0) 0
  else if (n == 1) 1
  else fibo(n - 2) + fibo(n - 1)

// the fold function
def fold[S, T](f : (S, T) => T, z : T, xs : List[S]) : T = xs match {
  case Nil => z
  case x :: ys => f(x, fold(f, z, ys))
}
```

For each obtained function in CPS-style, give an example of how to call it to
compute the same result of its original function in direct-style.  For `fact`
and `fibo`, do stack-overflow exceptions still occur when executing the
transformed program on large inputs?

For example, given the `map` function

```scala
def map[A, B](f : A => B, as : List[A]) : List[B] = as match {
  case Nil => Nil
  case a :: as => f(a) :: map(f, as)
}
```

, we present below two functions obtained by two different ways of manual
CPS-transformations.

```scala
def map_k[A, B, R](f : (A, B => R) => R, as : List[A],
                   k : List[B] => R) : R = as match {
  case Nil => k(Nil)
  case a :: as => f(a, (b : B) => map_k(f, as, (bs : List[B]) => k(b :: bs)))
}

def map_c[A, B, R](f : (A, B => R) => R, as : List[A],
                   c : List[B] => R) : R = as match {
  case Nil => c(Nil)
  case a :: as => map_c(f, as, (bs : List[B]) => f(a, (b : B) => c(b :: bs)))
}
```

.  The following examples demonstrate how `map_k` and `map_c` should be called:

```scala
// Example 1
map_k[Int, Int, List[Int]](
  (x : Int, k : Int => List[Int]) => k(x + 1), List(1, 2, 3),
  (xs : List[Int]) => xs
)

// Example 2
map_k[Int, Int, Unit](
  (x : Int, k : Int => Unit) => k(x + 1), List(1, 2, 3),
  (xs : List[Int]) => println(xs.toString)
)

// Example 3
map_c[Int, Int, List[Int]](
  (x : Int, k : Int => List[Int]) => k(x + 1), List(1, 2, 3),
  (xs : List[Int]) => xs
)

// Example 4
map_c[Int, Int, Unit](
  (x : Int, k : Int => Unit) => k(x + 1), List(1, 2, 3),
  (xs : List[Int]) => println(xs.toString)
)
```

Note that the return type of a continuation can really be _any_ type.  That is
why a polymorphic type `R` is used above.  Since it can be chosen arbitrarily
by need, in the [1st lecture](../../lecturenotes/13-cpstransformation.scala) on
CPS-transformation `Nothing` is used for the web-program example.  So for all
coninuations you will introduce when manually CPS-transforming the other three
functions, you can also choose any return type you want or leave it as
polymorphic.

Try to find out the difference between `map_k` and `map_c`.  This will give you
some clue to what form you should CPS-transform the other three functions.
_Hint:_ You may want to review the topics we have discussed in the [exercise
session](../../exercises/ex06.md).

## Automatic CPS-Transformation

In the [2nd lecture](../../lecturenotes/14-cpstransformation2.scala) on
CPS-transformation, we define two new syntactic categories, namely `CPSVal` and
`CPSExp`, for CPS-transformed terms.  In particular, the functioin `cps` takes
an `Exp` as input and returns a `CPSCont` as output.  CPS-transformation can be
done as a desugaring procedure which transforms an `Exp` to an `Exp`.  Start
with the following declarations, reimplement this desugaring-style
CPS-transformation.

```scala
abstract class Exp

case class Var(name : Symbol) extends Exp
case class Fun(pname : Symbol, body : Exp) extends Exp
case class App(fexp : Exp, aexp : Exp) extends Exp
case class Num(num : Int) extends Exp
case class Add(lhs : Exp, rhs : Exp) extends Exp
case class If0(cond : Exp, texp : Exp, fexp : Exp) extends Exp
case class Wth(vname : Symbol, vdef : Exp, body : Exp) extends Exp

def cps(exp : Exp) : Exp = ...
```

Recall that the `Wth`-construct can also be defined as follows:

```scala
def Wth(vname : Symbol, vdef : Exp, body : Exp) : Exp =
  App(Fun(vname, body), vdef)
```

Hence `Wth('x, Num(1), Add(Var('x), Num(1)))` and `App(Fun('x, Add(Var('x),
Num(1))), Num(1))` are equivalent.  Now use your `cps` to transform both.
Compare the results of the transformation.  What can you conlude from the
comparison?
