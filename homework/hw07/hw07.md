# Homework 7

## Problem 1

### Question 1

Read the following two program in Racket.  Describe what the function `count`
and `product` do and how they achieve it.

```racket
(define (loop procedure)
  (procedure)
  (loop procedure))

(define (count n)
  (let/cc exit
    (let ([m 1])
      (loop (lambda ()
              (if (= m n)
                  (exit m)
                  (begin (printf "~a~n" m)  ; print `m` in a line
                         (set! m (+ m 1)))))))))  ; increment `m` by 1

(define (product numbers)
  (let/cc return
    (letrec ([prod (lambda (ns)
                     (if (empty? ns)
                         1
                         (let ([n (first ns)])
                           (if (= n 0)
                               (return n)
                               (begin (printf "~a~n" n)
                                      (* n (prod (rest ns))))))))])
      (prod numbers))))
```

We have studied most constructs used in the program.  You should not need to
actually learn Racket to read the program.  In case you really need, take
a look at the [quick guide](http://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/).  If you are
not quite sure about what they do, copy and paste the program into the
definition area of [DrRacket](http://racket-lang.org/download/), click the
<button type="button">Run</button> button to load the program, type in the
following expressions (one at a time) in the interaction area (after the prompt
`>`) and hit <button type="button">Enter</button> to ask DrRacket to evaluate
the expression.  The last line of the output is the result of the expression.
Other lines are the output of `printf` in the above definitions.

```racket
(count 3)

(count 5)

(product (list 1 2 3 4 5))

(product (list 1 2 0 4 5))
```

### Question 2

Is it possible to implment the `Letcc` construct presented in the lecture on
[first-class continuations](../../lecturenotes/16-firstclasscontinuations.scala) 
using a direct-style (i.e., not CPS-transformed) interpreter plus
CPS-transformed programs?  If yes, give a definition of `Letcc(k : Symbol, body : Exp)`,
that is, `def Letcc(k : Symbol, body : Exp) : Exp = ...`, assuming `cps : Exp => Exp`.
If no, explain why.  _Hint:_ You may want to review 
[other combinations](https://github.com/klauso/PLT2013/blob/master/exercises/ex07.md#first-class-continuations)
we have discussed in the exercise session for the same question.

## Problem 2

1. Lambda-lift the following program.  Make sure the lambda-lifted program when
run gives the same result as the orginal one.

    ```scala
    val a : Int = 2

    val b : Int = 1

    def foldRight[A, B](f : (A, B) => B, z : B, l : List[A]) = {
      def foldr(l : List[A]) : B = l match {
        case Nil => z
        case x :: xs => f(x, foldr(xs))
      }
      foldr(l)
    }

    foldRight((x : Int, y : Int) => a * x + b, 1, List(3, 2, 1))
    ```

2. Defunctionalize the lambda-lifted program from Step 1.  Make sure the
defunctionalized program still gives the same result.

3. Repeat Step 1 and 2 for the following call of `foldRight`.

    ```scala
    foldRight((f : Int => Int, g : Int => Int) => (x : Int) => f(g(x)),
              (x : Int) => x,
              List((x : Int) => x + b, (x : Int) => a * x))
    ```

## Problem 3

### Programming Task 1

In all interpreters we have seen so far, binary operations on integers in the
object language are built into the language as primitive constructs.  Being a
primitive forces us to have a separate case for each in our interpreter to
handle them.  But it is obvious that the processing of these operations are
quite similar.  In fact, instead of building them into the language as
primitive constructs and bloating the interpreter to handle each of them
separately, we can join them into one case by treating them as _primitive
functions_.  This way, once we dedicate a case (_Hint:_ where?) in our
interpreter to handle primitive functions, we can recover support of addition
and multiplication in the object language.  The following declarations shows
exactly how to achieve this.

```scala
abstract class Exp

case class Var(name : Symbol) extends Exp
case class Fun(pname : Symbol, body : Exp) extends Exp
case class App(fexp : Exp, aexp : Exp) extends Exp
case class Num(num : Int) extends Exp
case class If0(cond : Exp, texp : Exp, fexp : Exp) extends Exp

abstract class Val

type Env = Map[Symbol, Val]
type Cnt = Val => Val

case class NumV(num : Int) extends Val
case class CloV(pname : Symbol, body : Exp, env : Env) extends Val  // closure
case class PrFV(metaf : (Exp, Env, Cnt) => Val) extends Val  // primitive function
```

Now addition and multiplication can be defined using `PrFV` and a meta-function
(in Scala) of type `(Exp, Env, ) => Val`.  For example, suppose addition is
defined as `PrFV(add)`, the meta-function `add` when applied (_Hint:_ when?) is
supposed to evaluate the passed-in expression (i.e., the left sub-expression of
addition) in the passed-in environment, in order to obtain the result of the
left sub-expression.  (_Hint:_ Be careful that addition and multiplication
defined in this way are supposed to be _curried_.  Think carefully what you
should return from `add`.)  Once we have the definitions for addition and
multiplication, we can bind them respectively to the name `'+` and `'*` in an
initial environment:

```scala
def add : (Exp, Env, Cnt) => Val = ...

def mul : (Exp, Env, Cnt) => Val = ... 

val iniEnv : Env = Map('+ -> PrFV(add), '* -> PrFV(mul))
val iniCnt : Cnt = v => v

def eval(exp : Exp, env : Env, cnt : Cnt) : Val = ...
```

When `eval` (in continuation-passing style) is called with `iniEnv` and
`iniCnt`, we will be able to evaluate expressions that use `Var('+)` and
`Var('*)`.  Your task is to give the right definitions to `add` and `mul`, and
then implement `eval`.  Remember to test your interpreter.

### Programming Task 2

The Scheme programming language (and its descent Racket) provides a primitive
function named `call-with-current-continuation`, usually abbreviated as
`call/cc` (or `callcc`).  `callcc` is called with another function as argument,
like `callcc(f)`.  The function `f` passed to `callcc` expects the current
continuation of the whole expression `callcc(f)` as argument.  The bound
continuation then may be used in the body of `f`.  Your task is to provide
`callcc` as a primitive function in the implmentation you have already obtained
from above.  Make sure your definition of `callcc` pass the following tests:

```scala
def evalTest(exp : Exp) : Val = eval(exp, iniEnv, iniCnt)

assert(evalTest(App(Var('callcc), Fun('k, Num(2)))) == NumV(2))
assert(evalTest(App(Var('callcc), Fun('k, App(Var('k), Num(2))))) == NumV(2))
assert(evalTest(App(Var('callcc), Fun('k, Add(Num(1), App(Var('k), Num(2)))))) == NumV(2))
```

It turns out that `Letcc` and `callcc` are mutually definable.  Give
a definition of `Letcc` using `callcc` (i.e., `def Letcc(k : Symbol, body : Exp) : Exp = ...`)
and then a definition of `callcc` using `Letcc` (i.e., `def callcc(f : Fun) : Exp = ...`).
For the latter, you do not have to include the interpreter from the lecture
note.  Just give the defintion.  _Hint:_ Answering this question first may give
you some clue to accomplish the programming task.
